🌟 **Greetings, fellow wanderer! I am @jonoedm13**, a seeker of knowledge and a weaver of digital spells. Allow me to introduce myself through the lens of archetypes:

---

## 🧙‍♂️ **The Magician**

In the mystical realm of code and neural networks, I wield my digital wand. My interests lie in crafting AI agents—creatures of logic and data. The CrewAi framework and LangChain are my arcane tools, and through them, I channel the unseen currents of information.

## 🧙‍♂️ **The Sage**

Within the neural networks' hidden layers, I seek wisdom. My studies delve into the intricate dance of neurons, their synaptic whispers echoing ancient truths. LLMs (Language Learning Models) are my scrolls, and I decipher their cryptic patterns.

## ⚔️ **The Adventurer**

Beyond the binary forests, I embark on quests. My first expedition: the **Crypto Companion App Powered by AI**. A map to guide traders through treacherous crypto seas, its sails catch the winds of real-time data. But that's not all—I've also charted a course for the **Maori Land Claim Navigator**. A compass for those seeking ancestral rights, it leads through legal mists and historical tides.

## 🌿 **The Call to Collaborate**

Brave souls, join me! Let's forge alliances, merge pull requests, and build bridges across digital chasms. Reach out via the sacred channels: make a pull request or send a missive to honeirimana@gmail.com. Together, we'll script our own epic saga.

## 🌟 **Fun Fact**

Ah, and did you know? In the realm of imagination, where pixels and dreams collide, **pigs can indeed fly**. Their wings are made of zeros and ones, and their oinks echo through the binary skies.
